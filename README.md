-----------------------------------

See below for important file locations and my contributions for the rebuttal
that are complete as of today 02/06/19.

1.  LOCATION FOR REBUTTAL / RESUBMISSION FILES: I've been saving my files in a
    folder called [REBUTTAL][This RepoCRF NPP EPHYS PAPER]

2.  MY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE REBUTTAL READY TO BE USED: (as of 02/06/19)

    -   I have a doc "Answers for Reviewer 1.docx" which discusses the questions
        from reviewer 1 about figure 2B.

    -   I have a .AI with new version of figure 2A with ethanol intake (g/kg)
        instead of licks.

    -   I have a References to Add.docx that has 3 references asked for by the
        reviewers (for phototagging and DID)

    -   I have a .docx called CRF Manuscript Submitted \_to
        update_JMI_02-06-19.docx which contains updated text, highlighted in
        blue.

    -   Additional phototagging details, plus reference.

    -   Location for DID references to be added to.

3.  LOCATION OF RAW PLEXON & NEUROEXPLORER DATA FILES FROM THE ORIGINAL EPHYS
    RECORDINGS:

    -   In Dropbox (Sparta Lab)Â Electrophysiology Data BackupCRF FINAL DATA SETS

    -   Note: I no long have access to these files on Dropbox so I cannot update
        them or maintain them or re-create any links to the foder.

4.  LOCATION OF ARCHIVE OF MY MATLAB & NEUROEXPLORER SCRIPTS

    -   [This Repo\\ Matlab & Neuroexplorer Scripts]

    -   Documentation:

        -   Original Workflow Docs are in the Documentation Folder

        -   Excel Spreadsheet containing the original and new simplified script
            names;

5.  INSTALLATION - To Use the Matlab Workflow You Must: 
    1. In Matlab,  click ```Set Path``` from Menu Bar \> ```Add With Subfolders:``` 
         - Select: [This Repo\Matlab & Neuroexplorer
    Scripts\ Matlab Scripts] <br>
    <br>
    2. In NeuroExplorer, click VIew \> Options -\>
    Scripts Tab and Template Tab:
        -  On Scripts Tab: 
        select folder - [This Repo&
    Neuroexplorer ScriptsNex Files] 
        - On Templates Tab: select fodler - [This
    Repo& Neuroexplorer ScriptsNex Files]


1.  WORK IN PROGRESS

    -   The new simplified workflow is being completed now.

    -   Currently (as of 04/26/19), there is a bug (that does not cause an
        error, so user would not notice it)

        -   When Importing the results of the bursting analysis, some cells that
            have burst intervals do not return burst events (the
            BurstSpikes,etc.)
